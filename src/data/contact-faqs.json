        "question": "Can I use the CDL Prep results for the real test?",
        "answer": "No. While our CDL Prep test is designed to mirror the actual CDL in content and format closely, it is intended solely as a practice tool to help learners prepare and familiarize themselves with the test. The results from our practice tests, while useful for gauging one's progress, do not carry the same weight or recognition as the official test."
